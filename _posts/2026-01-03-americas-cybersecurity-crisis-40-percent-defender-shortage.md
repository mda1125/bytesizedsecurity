40% of America's cyber defenders are missing.

Here's why that number should scare you—and what’s at risk:

Imagine your company had nearly half of its security team gone overnight.

That’s the current state of the U.S. federal cybersecurity workforce at CISA.

I used to think government agencies were slow but stable. But right now, critical IT experts are furloughed or gone. Hiring is frozen. Contracts are expiring with no renewals in sight.

One breach—SolarWinds-style—and recovery could take years.

The brain drain is worse than the budget cuts.

Institutional knowledge is walking out the door. Contractors with years of expertise are forced to find jobs elsewhere. When they leave, their knowledge disappears too.

Cybersecurity doesn’t wait for budget resolutions or politics.

Delays now mean vulnerabilities later.

Here’s what this means for your organization:

- Threat intel sharing slows down
- Government support during cyber incidents weakens
- Supply chain risks grow fast

Don’t assume federal coverage will catch weak spots in your systems.

Federal cybersecurity isn’t catching up anymore. It’s slipping.
