An insider at *CrowdStrike*—a top cybersecurity firm—just leaked sensitive internal info to hackers.  

Yes, the company hired to stop insider threats had one themselves.  

Here’s the real lesson:  
If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere.  

Insider threats aren’t just an “IT problem.” They’re a *people* problem.  

If your security plan is all tools and no trust, you’re already vulnerable.
