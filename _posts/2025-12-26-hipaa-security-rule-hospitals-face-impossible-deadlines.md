Most healthcare systems aren’t ready for this.

The HIPAA Security Rule overhaul demands full compliance in just 180 days:

- Full MFA rollout
- Total network segmentation
- Thousands of BAAs renegotiated

Here’s the problem:

Cybersecurity in a hospital isn’t like a tech startup.

Every network change hits live patient care.

Every access control shift affects clinicians mid-shift.

And "just update your firewall" risks delaying chemotherapy or surgeries.

CHIME, representing over 100 healthcare organizations, pushed back—hard.

Why?

Because HHS says MFA takes 1.5 hours to deploy.

A hospital CISO says it takes months.

Same with segmentation. HHS? 4.5 hours. CIOs? Weeks to redesign, test, and deploy.

BAA agreements? Thousands of legal renegotiations—minimum a year of work.

And while these updates are critical—especially after Change Healthcare's ransomware disaster—they must be workable.

Secure networks don't protect patients if clinical care grinds to a halt.

So what's the fix?

- Stronger financial support (like the Cybersecurity & Resilience Act proposes)
- Clear, prioritized rollouts based on actual risk
- Technical flexibility for clinical realities
- True collaboration between regulators and providers

You don’t protect patient data by forcing hospitals into chaos.

You do it by understanding how hospitals operate—and building security around that.
