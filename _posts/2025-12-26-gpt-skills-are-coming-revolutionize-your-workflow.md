Custom GPTs are about to get a whole lot smarter.

Here’s how ChatGPT “Skills” will change your workflow forever:

Right now, GPTs respond based on prompt engineering alone.

But that means repeating context, reloading apps, and hitting limits fast.

Claude fixed this with "Skills"—and now OpenAI is testing its own version.

I’ve used Claude Skills to:

- Build cleaner frontend code  
- Reuse domain knowledge across conversations  
- Automate report formatting without starting from scratch  

Each "Skill" acts like a lego block—custom workflows, code snippets, even domain-specific tools, instantly available on demand.

Here’s why it works:

- No more re-prompting the same instructions  
- Works across chat, code, and API  
- Executes actual code, not just guesses  
- Load only what’s needed—faster, cleaner output  

OpenAI’s version will likely include:

- Slash commands with a Skills editor  
- Quick conversion of custom GPTs into reusable Skills  
- Composable tasks that save you real dev hours  

If you build with GPTs, imagine calling a skill like:  
`/frontend-review`, `/policy_drafter`, or `/analytics_summary`  
And it just works.

One habit to start today:

List 3 repeatable tasks you do with GPT.  
These will make great first-generation Skills.

This is where prompt engineering becomes true productivity engineering.
