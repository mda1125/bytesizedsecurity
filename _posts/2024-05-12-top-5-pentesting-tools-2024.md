A roundup of the essential tools every ethical hacker needs in their arsenal this year. From network scanners to exploitation frameworks, we cover the industry standards.

## 1. Burp Suite Professional

Burp Suite remains the gold standard for web application security testing. The 2024 version brings enhanced scanning capabilities and improved AI-assisted vulnerability detection.

**Key Features:**
- Advanced web vulnerability scanner
- Intruder for automated customized attacks
- Repeater for manual request manipulation
- Extensibility through BApp Store

## 2. Nmap + NSE Scripts

The Network Mapper continues to be indispensable for reconnaissance and network discovery. Combined with Nmap Scripting Engine, it becomes a powerful vulnerability assessment tool.

```bash
# Comprehensive scan with service detection and vulnerability scripts
nmap -sV -sC --script=vuln -oA scan_results 192.168.1.0/24

# Aggressive scan for CTF environments
nmap -A -T4 -p- target.com
```

## 3. Metasploit Framework

The world's most used penetration testing framework gets better every year. The 2024 updates include new modules for cloud infrastructure and container environments.

```bash
# Quick exploitation workflow
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 10.10.10.10
set LPORT 4444
exploit
```

## 4. Nuclei

Nuclei has rapidly become a favorite for its speed and extensibility. With thousands of community-contributed templates, it's perfect for large-scale vulnerability scanning.

```bash
# Run all CVE templates against a target
nuclei -u https://target.com -t cves/

# Run specific template
nuclei -u https://target.com -t http/technologies/wordpress-detect.yaml
```

## 5. BloodHound

For Active Directory environments, BloodHound is essential. It uses graph theory to reveal hidden attack paths that would be impossible to find manually.

**Use Cases:**
- Identify shortest paths to Domain Admin
- Find Kerberoastable accounts
- Discover AS-REP roastable users
- Map delegation rights

## Honorable Mentions

- **Gobuster/Feroxbuster** — Directory and DNS bruteforcing
- **SQLMap** — Automated SQL injection exploitation
- **Hashcat** — Password recovery and cracking
- **Wireshark** — Network protocol analysis
- **Ghidra** — Reverse engineering
